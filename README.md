# WinBox on Linux

WinBox is one of the last hold out applications in my transition to 100% Linux. This repository was established to create a Docker image to run WinBox in a container using Wine.

# Example Usage:
```
git clone git@github.com:tagadvance/winbox.git
cd winbox
echo "alias winbox=$(pwd)/winbox.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
winbox
```
